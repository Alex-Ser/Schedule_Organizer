How the program functions:

  -Enter the schedule for the entire week for each employee in the excel sheet.
  -Run the python script.
  
  This will result in a new excel sheet with 7 sheets each sheet representing a day of the week. And each day corresponds to an organized shifts in increasing orders
of the cashiers and a specific organized way for the managers schedule as the General Manager requested. This program saves alot of time and effort which can be invested
somewhere else in the buisness.
